  <p>Jellyfish and sea <span class="secret">jellies</span> are the informal common names given to the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa,<span class="redacted">a major part of the phylum Cnidaria.</span> Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming
    marine animals with umbrella-shaped bells and trailing tentacles, although a few are not mobile, being anchored to the seabed by stalks. The bell can pulsate to provide propulsion and highly efficient <span class="secret">locomotion</span>. The tentacles are armed with
    stinging cells and may be used to capture prey and defend against predators. Jellyfish have a complex life cycle; the medusa is normally the sexual phase, the planula larva can disperse widely and is followed by a sedentary polyp phase. </p>
  <p>Jellyfish are found all over the world, from surface waters to the deep sea. Scyphozoans (the "true jellyfish") are exclusively marine, but some <span class="secret">hydrozoans</span> with a similar appearance live in freshwater.<span class="redacted">Large, often
      colorful, jellyfish are common in coastal zones worldwide</span>. The medusae of most species are fast growing, mature within a few months and die soon after breeding, but the polyp stage, attached to the seabed, may be much more long-lived.
    Jellyfish have been in existence for at least 500 million years,[1] and possibly 700 million years or more, making them the oldest <span class="secret">multi-organ</span> animal group.[2]</p>
  <p><span class="redacted"> Jellyfish are eaten by humans in certain cultures,</span> being considered a delicacy in some Asian countries, where species in the <span class="secret">Rhizostomae</span> order are pressed and salted to remove excess water. They are also used in
    research, where the green <span class="secret">fluorescent</span> protein, used by some species to cause bioluminescence, has been adapted as a fluorescent marker for genes inserted into other cells or organisms. </p>
  <p>The stinging cells used by jellyfish to subdue their prey can also injure humans.<span class="redacted"> Many thousands of swimmers are stung every year</span>, with effects ranging from mild discomfort to serious <span class="secret">injury</span> or even death; small box
    jellyfish are responsible for many of these deaths. When conditions are favourable, jellyfish can form vast swarms. These can be responsible for damage to fishing gear by filling fishing nets, and sometimes clog the <span class="secret">cooling</span> systems of power and
    desalination plants which draw their water from the sea. </p>
